# Traffic-Light-System_202401100400070
This is a PYTHON code for traffic light system that generates graphs on the basis of duration of light and provides output in a visualized manner.
My problem statement was to generate a traffic light system which helps the urban areas to regulate the traffic. As in urban areas like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi etc. vehicles get stuck in traffic so generating a fast traffic light system will eventually help.
