# Traffic-Light-System_202401100400070
I am Ayushmaan, currently in my 1st year of Bachelor's Of Technology (CSE).
Made my very first project using PYTHON.
This is a PYTHON code for traffic light system that generates graphs on the basis of duration of light and provides output in a visualized manner.
My problem statement was to generate a traffic light system which helps the urban areas to regulate the traffic. As in urban areas like Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi etc. vehicles get stuck in traffic so generating a fast traffic light system will eventually help.
I used "os" library to clear up the cache so previous outputs don't stack up and take the memory, making it more efficient and fast. Used matplot library to generate graphs. Made use of functions and #comments for better readability of code.
